  title: Positivity for toric Kac polynomials in higher depth
  abstract: >
    <p>Kac polynomials are counts of quiver representations over finite fields, whose coefficients are non-negative and encode the graded dimensions of the so-called BPS Lie algebra. This Lie algebra sits inside the cohomological Hall algebra built from the cohomology of certain quiver moduli.
    <p>In this work, I study a generalisation of Kac polynomials to rings of truncated power series over finite fields, for certain dimension vectors. The main result is that these polynomials have non-negative coefficients and encode the graded dimensions of a certain subspace in the cohomology of jet spaces over the aforementioned quiver moduli. This behaviour is quite similar to that of the usual Kac polynomials.

  title: Tensor products of quiver bundles
  abstract: <p>In this work we introduce a notion of tensor product of (twisted) quiver representations with relations in the category of O_X-modules. As a first application of our notion, we see that tensor products of polystable quiver bundles are polystable and later we use this to both deduce a quiver version of the Segre embedding and to identify distinguished closed subschemes of $\mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbb{C})$-character varieties of free abelian groups.

  title: CoHAs of torsion sheaves on weighted projective lines
  abstract: <p>In this talk, I describe the cohomological Hall algebra of torsion sheaves on a weighted projective line with weights $(2,\ldots,2)$ in terms of generators and relations. This extends work of Franzen--Reineke on the CoHA of semistable representations of the Kronecker quiver.

  title: Cohomological Hall algebras of Higgs sheaves on curves over $\mathrm{M}_g$ and positivity of Kac polynomials
  abstract: <p>We define a version of the cohomological Hall algebra of Higgs sheaves which lives over the moduli space of smooth genus $g$ curves, and show that it forms a local system. We deduce from this the existence of a 'generic' version of the BPS Lie algebra, which is a Lie algebra object in the category of $\mathrm{GSp}(2g,\mathbb{C})$-modules and use this to prove some strong positivity property of Kac polynomials counting indecomposable vector bundles over curves defined over finite fields.
