  title: Positivity for toric Kac polynomials in higher depth
  abstract: >
    <p>Kac polynomials are counts of quiver representations over finite fields, whose coefficients are non-negative and encode the graded dimensions of the so-called BPS Lie algebra. This Lie algebra sits inside the cohomological Hall algebra built from the cohomology of certain quiver moduli.
    <p>In this work, I study a generalisation of Kac polynomials to rings of truncated power series over finite fields, for certain dimension vectors. The main result is that these polynomials have non-negative coefficients and encode the graded dimensions of a certain subspace in the cohomology of jet spaces over the aforementioned quiver moduli. This behaviour is quite similar to that of the usual Kac polynomials.
